From May 13th to 17th, I had the pleasure to attend the <a href="https://2024.ieee-icra.org/">41st IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)</a>, one of the most prestigious conferences in robotics, held in Yokohama, Japan. 
I presented our paper <em>Towards Fault-Tolerant Deployment of Mobile Robot Navigation in the Edge: An Experimental Study</em> both, as a talk as well as at the interactive poster session. 
Our work on edge-robotics was well received and appreciated by the robotics community sparking interesting and fruitful discussions. 
Finally, it was great meeting old friends and making new connections.
From beginning as a Ph.D. candidate in 2015 researching neuromorphic computing, distributed representations and spiking neural networks in the car to working as a Research Scientist on neuromorphic engineering, power-efficient computing for AI, and robotics, it always was a great pleasure and utmost honor to work for this amazing company.
