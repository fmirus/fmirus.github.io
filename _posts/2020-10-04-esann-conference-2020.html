  From October 2nd to 4th, I had the pleasure to attend the <a href="https://www.esann.org/">28th European Symposium on Artificial Neural Networks (ESANN) 2020</a> held virtually. 
  There were a lot of interesting research sessions and I had the opportunity to present our paper <a href="https://www.esann.org/sites/default/files/proceedings/2020/ES2020-81.pdf" target="_blank"><em>Detection of abnormal driving situations using distributed representations and unsupervised learning</em></a>. 
  If you are interested in this research, feel free to contact me.
