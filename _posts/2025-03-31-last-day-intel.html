After almost four exciting years, today marks my last official day with <a href="https://www.intel.de/content/www/de/de/research/overview.html" target="_blank">Intel Labs </a> Karlsruhe and I want to take a moment to reflect on my time. Working for Intel Labs, one of the leading and most innovative corporate research labs in the world, has been an extraordinary journey, and I feel truly grateful for all the experiences and lessons I've gained along the way but even more for the connections with the remarkable people I made during my time there.
</p>
<p>
First and foremost, I want to express my sincere gratitude to my manager and mentor, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kay-ulrich-scholl/" target="_blank">Kay-Ulrich Scholl</a>: A heartfelt thank you for your guidance, encouragement and support throughout this chapter — it’s been a privilege to work with and learn from you.
Furthermore, I want to thank <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/frederik-pasch-8b781916b/" target="_blank">Frederik Pasch</a>: collaborating with you on topics including edge-robotics and our open-source library scenario execution has been a highlight, and I’ll always value the creativity and energy you brought to every project we tackled together.
I'll particularly remember the last minute paper submissions and demo preparation sessions where we worked tirelessly to put things together and make robots work on time.
To the rest of the AMSRL team, particularlyg<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-ing-fabian-oboril-0b1b9a53/" target="_blank">Dr.-Ing. Fabian Oboril</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cb99/" target="_blank">Cornelius Bürkle</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-ing-bernd-gassmann-47556011b/" target="_blank">Dr.-Ing. Bernd Gassmann</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliojarquin/" target="_blank">Julio Jarquin</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/qutub-syed-sha/"
    target="_blank">Qutub Syed Sha</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ralf-graefe-92170468/" target="_blank">Ralf Gräfe</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/norbert-st%C3%B6ffler-73293536/" target="_blank">Norbert Stöffler</a>: thank you for creating a culture of collaboration and innovation as well as for the exceptional camaraderie within the team.
It has been a true pleasure to work with each and every one of you.
</p>
<p>
I'd also like to extend my gratitude to everyone beyond my immediate team at Intel particularly <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thijsmetsch/" target="_blank">Thijs Metsch</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/philipp-stratmann-57a06839/" target="_blank">Philipp Stratmann</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mathis-richter/" target="_blank">Mathis Richter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ed-brazil-45b098114/" target="_blank">Ed Brazil</a>, <a
    href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ignacio-alvarez/" target="_blank">Dr. Ignacio Alvarez</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amit-baxi-03a83743/" target="_blank">Amit Baxi</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaybeesathya/" target="_blank">Jayabalaji Sathiyamoorth</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christian-h-soerensen/" target="_blank">Christian Soerensen</a> and many more.
Finally, I want to close this post with a quote by Robert H. Schuller: “Tough times don't last, tough people do”. I'm convinced Intel Corporation and the people working there will come out stronger than ever. All the best and success to all of you. 
</p>
<p>
While change can be bittersweet, I'm excited about what lies ahead and look forward to the next chapter of my career while staying in touch with the connections from the previous one. Here's to new beginnings, and to the memories we’ve built along the way!
