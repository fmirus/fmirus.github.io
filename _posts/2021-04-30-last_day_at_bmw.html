<p>
After five and a half exciting years, today marks my last day at <a href="http://www.bmwgroup.com"> BMW Group</a>.
From beginning as a Ph.D. candidate in 2015 researching neuromorphic computing, distributed representations and spiking neural networks in the car to working as a Research Scientist on neuromorphic engineering, power-efficient computing for AI, and robotics, it always was a great pleasure and utmost honor to work for this amazing company.
</p>
<p>
During my time at BMW Group, I received the Ph.D. degree for my thesis <em><a href="https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/?id=1519881" target="_blank">Towards a cognitive automotive environment model: a novel approach based on distributed representations and spiking neural networks</a></em> from <a href="https://www.tum.de/en/"> Technical University of Munich</a>, I co-organized the workshop <a href="https://cogvehicles2019.github.io/">Towards Cognitive Vehicles: perception, learning and decision making
    under real-world constraints. Is bio-inspiration helpful?</a> at <a href="http://www.iros2019.org"> IROS 2019</a> and led (parts of) several projects on neuromorphic computing and AI accelerators.
</p>

Apart from the opportunity to work on such exciting research topics and my personal and professional growth, I was fortunate enough to meet a lot of truly amazing colleagues.
In particular, I would like to thank <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hjvoegel/" target="_blank">Hans-Joerg Voegel</a>, my manager and mentor of my Ph.D. work, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinarend/" target="_blank">Martin Arend</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-würtenberger-7a875438/" target="_blank">Michael Wuertenberger</a>, my department leaders during my Ph.D. years, as well as some great colleagues: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dringmohsenkaboli/"
    target="_blank">Mohsen Kaboli</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/oliver-wick-19309957/" target="_blank">Oliver Wick</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/viktor-rack-30838414b/" target="_blank">Viktor Rack</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christoph-segler/" target="_blank">Christoph Segler </a> and many more.
It's been a pleasure working with you. Thank you.

While I am sad to close the door on this chapter of my career, I couldn’t be more excited for the next one.
As of May 1st, I will be joining <a href="https://www.intel.de/content/www/de/de/research/overview.html" target="_blank">Intel Labs </a> as <em>Researcher Dependable Automated Driving and Robotics</em>.
I'm curious and excited about the challenges and opportunities this next step holds for me.
