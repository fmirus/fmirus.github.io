  From August 3rd to 7th, I'm attending the introduction week of the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/telluride2020"> 2020 Telluride Neuromorphic Engineering Workshop</a> held virtually. 
  The introduction week is followed by a month of collaborative project work, I'm taking part in as well.
