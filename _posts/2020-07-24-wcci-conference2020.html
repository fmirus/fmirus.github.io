  From July 19th to 24th, I had the pleasure to attend the <a href="https://wcci2020.org/"> 2020 World Congress on Computational Intelligence </a> held virtually. 
  There were a lot of interesting research sessions and I had the opportunity to present our papers <em>The Importance of Balanced Data Sets: Analyzing a Vehicle Trajectory Prediction Model based on Neural Networks and Distributed Representations</em> and <em>Analyzing the Capacity of Distributed Vector Representations to Encode Spatial Information</em> during the sessions. 
  If you are interested in this research, feel free to contact me.
