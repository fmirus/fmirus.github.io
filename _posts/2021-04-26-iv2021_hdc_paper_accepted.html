<p>
I'm happy to share that our paper <em>Multivariate time Series Anaysis for Driving Style Classification using neural Networks and Hyperdimensional Computing</em> authored by Kenny Schlegel, myself, Peer Neubert and Peter Protzel  has been accepted to the <a href="https://2021.ieee-iv.org/">32nd IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium 2021</a>.
If you are interested in this research, you can find the  <a href="https://github.com/TUC-ProAut/HDC_driving_style_classification" target="_blank">source code</a> on Github.
I will share a link to the paper once it is published.
