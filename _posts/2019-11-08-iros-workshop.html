<p>
    The last workshop day - and with it our workshop on Cognitive Vehicles - concluded this year's <a href="https://iros2019.org/" target="_blank">IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)</a>.
    The workshop had a dense and interactive program.
    We organized three sessions of academic talks on perception, learning, and cognition, featuring such prominent researchers as Michael Milford, Davide Scaramuzza, Justus Piater, Gregor Schöner, Robert Haschke, and Mauro da Lio.
    These were complimented with an industrial session with talks from BMW’s Vice president of E/E Architectures, Technologies and AI, Michael Würtenberger, a human-factors specialist (Volvo and University of Leeds) Gustav Markkula, and entrepreneur and autonomous driving visionary Tarin Ziyaee.
    The talks were intermixed with poster sessions and three panel discussions with the speakers.
