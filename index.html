	  <h3>Hi, I'm <strong>{{ site.author }}</strong>.</h3>
		<h3>
			I'm currently working as Research Expert with <a href="https://www.bmwgroup.com"> BMW Group</a> Research, New Technologies, Innovations on neuromorphic computing, AI accelerators and power-efficient computing for AI, machine learning and robotics.
            I received the Ph.D. degree in <a href="http://www.ei.tum.de/en/welcome/"> Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> from
			<a href="https://www.tum.de/en/homepage/"> Technical University of Munich</a> in 2020.
            My <a href="https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/?id=1519881" target="_blank">Ph.D. thesis </a> investigated neuromorphic technology and cognitive modeling techniques for automotive environment modeling in the area of automated driving. 
			My initial training was in mathematics with minor in computer science at <a href="http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/index_e.html"> Heidelberg University</a>.
			<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}assets/docs/diploma_thesis.pdf"> My diploma thesis</a> was on algorithmic galois theory in positive characteristic.
			My current research interests include neuromorphic engineering and machine intelligence in automotive context.
